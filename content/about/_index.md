My name is John Harris and I currently live in Seattle, WA (via London, UK and Boston, MA).

I have a typical IT background _(couple of Film Studies degrees followed by 4 years as a basketball coach)_ and my current role is running DevOps & Continuous Delivery consulting for LeftShift IT. I'm a strong advocate of open-source, 12-factor principles, micro-services and cloud native design and spend most of my time advising clients and / or implementing the above for them.

I write enough code to be dangerous but have never been paid to be a 'software engineer'. I got started with HTML, CSS and JS when I was 10 years old and progressed through Java (in college, never again) and Python to my current favourite Go (which I first learned to fix a bug in the Docker engine). I'm also learning Ruby (despite the syntax burning my eyes) so that I can help tutor my fiancée through her coding bootcamp.

I get to as many conferences and meetups as I can and am aiming to present at some upcoming DevOps themed events later in 2017. This blog is a collection of thoughts, tutorials and experiences that I hope will be as helpful to readers as the many blogs which have provided (and continue to provide) assistance and guidance to me (giving back to communities is important). If I can help you in any way, please get in touch.

I am by no means an expert in every topic that I post, but [_to teach is to learn_](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/).

I'm a strong believer in continuous improvement ([_Kaizen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)); comments and constructive criticism are _always_ welcome.

My resume is available at [resume.johnharris.io](https://resume.johnharris.io) but I am not currently available for work.
