### Personal

Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet! My name is John Harris and I currently live in Seattle, WA (via London, UK and Boston, MA) with my wife and our [2 cats](https://www.instagram.com/tiger_and_leila/).

I got interested in computers around 9 yrs old and coded an X-Files fan guide in notepad using HTML before having to learn some hardware stuff to figure out why the original Rainbow Six game wouldn't load past level 5 without a graphics card.

Love of movies set me on the way to two film degrees before lack of $$ and a desire to solve problems led me back to computing (via professional basketball coaching, go figure :shrug:).

### Career

I worked in technical training before moving up to run DevOps services for a London-based consulting firm. That container thing seemed pretty cool so I moved to [Docker](https://docker.com) to lead the West coast Technical Account Management (TAM) team for just over a year before joining ([newly-acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/vmware-acquires-heptio-the-startup-founded-by-2-co-founders-of-kubernetes/)) [Heptio](https://heptio.com).

Now in the Kubernetes Architecture team in the [Cloud Native BU](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/cloud-native-apps.html) @ VMware and helping internal and external customers in their journey to operationalising and innovating around Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies.

This blog is a collection of thoughts, tutorials and experiences that I hope will be as helpful to readers as the many blogs which have provided (and continue to provide) assistance and guidance to me. Giving back to communities is important and I believe we should all do it as much as we can.

I am by no means an expert in every topic that I post, but [_to teach is to learn_](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/). If you have questions, comments, suggestions or corrections **or I can help you in any way** please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/johnharris85)!

### Community

I love getting involved in the community and volunteer as an industry mentor at [ADA Developers Academy](https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/) in Seattle.

I also help run several meetups including:

- [Seattle CoffeeOps](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-CoffeeOps/)
- [Eastside CoffeeOps](https://www.meetup.com/Eastside-CoffeeOps/)
- [West Seattle Linux User Group](https://www.meetup.com/WSeaLUG/)

### Talks

I have given several talks at meetups and conferences and want to get more involved in those activities this year. Here's a list of talks / panels I've given over the last year or so:

- [Proactive Ops for Container Orchestration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLXPDGwF4eg) @ DockerCon 2018 (San Francisco, CA)
- [Cloud Native: Past, Present, and Future Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wCd-K-4j-0) @ KubeCon 2018 (Seattle, WA)
